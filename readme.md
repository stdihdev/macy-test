# Code Assessment

### Time Limit: 6 hours

Please try to complete this exercise within six hours. If you're not able to complete it by then, please provide a link to your work along with a list of challenges, reasons why they were a challenge, and how you would overcome them if you had more time. Please do **not** spend more than 6 hours on this assessment. This is an open-ended assessment, there is no true **finished** state.

 **It's more important to see your process and approach than it is to deliver production-ready code (though it doesn't hurt).**

We'll be looking for correctness, thoughtfulness, efficiency, and intent.

The goal is to demonstrate your abilities in; 

- parsing and manipulating data
- using a third-party library
- developing responsive & efficient web pages with readable code


## Tasks:

1. Using the files found in `/public`, correct all errors on the web page. The page should be responsive and adhere to strict HTML/CSS/JS standards. Vanilla Javascript is preferred, but not required.

2. Build a data structure that captures the count of each word in the content of the `bodyHtml` field(s) from JSON document `/test_feed.json`.

3. Utilize the Chart.js library (http://www.chartjs.org/) to visualize the results on the web page. You're free to implement it in anyway you see fit, including the use of other libraries.

4. Using git, put the files in a publicly accessible repo so that your work can be run on a local machine.
